<p style="text-align: justify;">
I am a Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) remote sensing scientist with strong background in SAR techniques and earth observation-based product development.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Currently, I am a postdoctoral researcher at the NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), working on mapping forest biomass using SAR data-based modelling framework under the guidance of Dr. Sassan S. Saatchi . Prior to joining JPL, I served as a Research Scientist at the North Eastern Region Node for Disaster Risk Reduction under ISRO's North-Eastern Space Application Centre (NE-SAC), developing pipelines for automated operational applications. I also have industry experience as a SAR consultant with Geo Climate Risk Solutions, where I provided technical insights on data fusion for biomass assessment projects.

I hold a Ph.D. in Civil Engineering specializing in Geoinformatics from the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur (IITK) working under the supervision of Prof. Onkar Dikshit. During my Ph.D. I had the privilege to be a visiting researcher at Department of Electronics, Information and Bioengineering, Politecnico di Milano under Dr. Stefano Tebaldini. Before my Ph.D. tenure, I worked with Prof. Kusala Rajendran as a project assistant for seismic mapping and fieldwork at the Centre for Earth Sciences, Indian Institute of Science . I also have a  masterâ€™s degree in Remote Sensing and GIS and bachelor's degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering from Anna University.
